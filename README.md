# Casim.ir

## Yet Another URL Shortener (or Shrinker)

Casim.ir is inspired by — and tries to find its way between — both [lilURL](http://lilurl.sourceforge.net/) and [xav.cc](http://xav.cc/) 's [sfShortUrlPlugin](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfShortUrlPlugin), the first lacking some essential features and the later needing a whole [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) environment, as the location implies.

Casim.ir is both available online at [casim.ir](http://casim.ir/) and as a [download](https://github.com/chusopr/casimir/releases) for self hosting.

It only needs PHP and MySQL to run. Just install it, following the instructions in the readme file, and enjoy it!

The development is [hosted on GitHub](http://github.com/chusopr/casimir), so you can fork it and help me enhance it at will!

*Disclaimer:* I didn't try to follow any PHP golden development rules, it just had to work as I needed.
